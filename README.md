Pearl, also known as Moti, is revered in Vedic astrology for its calming, emotional, and spiritual benefits. Associated with the Moon, the Pearl gemstone is known to enhance mental peace, emotional balance, and intuition. It is especially beneficial for individuals suffering from stress, anxiety, or sleep disorders. Astrologers often recommend Moti for Cancer moon signs or those with a weak or afflicted Moon in their birth charts.

Wearing a genuine Pearl can help strengthen the Moonâ€™s influence in one's life, resulting in a more nurturing and emotionally secure personality. It fosters creativity, promotes love and harmony in relationships, and brings prosperity in personal and professional life. Pearls are also known to boost facial radiance and are believed to have cooling effects on the body.

However, it is essential to wear only high-quality, natural Pearls after astrological consultation. Synthetic or poor-quality Pearls might not yield the desired effects. The gem should ideally be set in silver and worn on a Monday during the Shukla Paksha (waxing moon) after purification and mantra chanting.
